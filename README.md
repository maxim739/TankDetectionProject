# Tank Detection Project
This is an object detection project mounted on a tank drive platform that can track a known image placed on someone. This could be useful for carrying a camera and filming that person, or carrying goods for that person.

2/12/2022 - detectnetprint.py works and prints the index and location of the center of bounding boxes to the terminal
  - The code throws an error 1/3 of the time I try to run the script, saying index is not defined. When the same script is ran again it works
  - Im guessing this is due to a persistent resource problem, where I don't have enough resources on my Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB
